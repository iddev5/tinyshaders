# tinyshaders

Tiny shaders is a simple-to-use online shader playground running in the web. Using this website, shaders can be programmed and tested live directly in your web browser.  

Shaders are basically small programs which run on the GPU for every pixel of your screen. They are responsible for the logic involved in deciding what color will a particular pixel output. Shaders are programmed in a variety of languages like GLSL, HLSL, MSL, WGSL etc.  

This particular project let's you use GLSL as it is the standard shader programming language used by WebGL, a graphics programming API. Your browser must support WebGL for this website to work properly and JavaScript should be enabled.
